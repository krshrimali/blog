Hi everyone, I'm back to - writing daily update blogs. Just sharing what I did today, and documenting my progress. Now of course it won't contain everything I do, but yep - everything related to learning and things I'm passionate about.

**Reading**

* Just In Time Compilation (Wiki):
  - Wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation
  - Honestly, I wanted to start with a few papers on it, but Wikipedia does give enough background and sets some context.

**Leetcode problems**

For some context, I started doing these problems to brush up my problem solving skills. The following problems were solved in both Rust and C++. I'll share the rust codes in a few days.

* [K Closest Points to the origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)
* [Jump Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/)
* [Jump Game - II](https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/)

**Miscellaneous**

* Spent some time fixing my colorscheme in neovim changing because of tmux :/ I was wondering what went wrong. Finally, I found this: [neovim losing colorscheme when in tmux](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60309665/neovim-losing-colorscheme-when-in-tmux-all-past-solutions-i-see-dont-work-for). I've updated my [dotfiles](https://github.com/krshrimali/dotfiles) with the fix in case anyone is still using it.

**Ending words**

Still starting off with the momentum. Going to take some time, but I hope to continue doing it.
