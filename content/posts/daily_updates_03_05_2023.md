Okay, I think I should just accept this, while at work, it will be very hard for me to go and actually code something. And it makes sense, honestly at this stage - I feel like giving 50% of the time to reading + thinking, and 20% to implementing + 30% on iterating and feedback. So you'll see more links about reading etc. over here.

1. [Design a basic search engine (Google or Bing) | System Design Interview Prep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LTXCcVRQi0&list=LL&index=7)
2. [Design a Payment System - System Design Interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olfaBgJrUBI&list=LL&index=6)

That would be it, to be honest - not a lot. I've started reading through fasterthanlime's videos on Silly Fast Fresh Deploys, I'll share progress on it soon once I've some learnings.

TODOs:

1. Explore HVM: https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM, looks interesting at least.
2. Read through: [Specifying and Verifying Higher-order Rust Iterators](https://hal.science/hal-03827702v2/document).
3. Record a video for YouTube!
4. [Stabilizing async fn in traits in 2023](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/05/03/stabilizing-async-fn-in-trait.html)

Alright, thank you all for reading. :) See y'all tomorrow!
