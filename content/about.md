Hello World! I'm Kushashwa Ravi Shrimali (friends call me Kush, world knows me as krshrimali), a Computer Science and Engineering Graduate from IIIT-NR. I work as a Research Engineer at [Grid.AI](http://grid.ai/), mostly on [PyTorch Lightning Ecosystem](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning). Previously, I work as a Software Developer (PyTorch dev team) at Quansight Labs. I love development, optimization and reading source codes! Have explored a lot of fields during my graduation, development is what I found the most intuitive for myself.

I stream every day on my [Twitch Channel (BuffetCodes)](https://twitch.tv/buffetcodes). Please consider following and joining the streams, at 9 PM IST / 8:30 AM PT. The streams are recorded and uploaded on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/kushashwaraviShrimali).

Over the weekends - I contribute to opensource, and write blogs (where you are right now). But that's not it, I like singing (not that I sing well xD), dancing on any random music I like and discussing technology (mostly Linux, vim, and programming) & politics.

I love writing impactful codes! My work doesn't stop at getting the accuracy. I love optimizing the models to help deploy in real-time.
