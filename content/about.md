I work as a Software Developer at Quansight Labs in the PyTorch team. I love development, whatever I write or see - my passion is in optimizing pipelines. You'll mostly finding me exploring libraries, source codes and reading technical books/blogs.

I run my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/kushashwaraviShrimali) to share what I have learnt so far apart from this blog.
