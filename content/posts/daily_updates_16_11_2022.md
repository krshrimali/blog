Hi everyone, Day 3 of this series of daily updates. Woke up fairly early (~6 AM), and started working. Though it seemed productive to me, but you won't see a lot of content here today - just one of those days where I didn't do a lot of different things, I guess. :)

**Projects/Learning**:

1. I made my [rust-leetcode](https://github.com/krshrimali/rust-leetcode/) repository public today. It currently contains 12 solved problems, you'll see huge difference between the first few codes to the last few codes. I've been learning, please don't refer it for learning. I'm just documenting it there.
2. Autogenerate README once a new file is added to my Rust Leetcode repository:
* I first started with writing a Python script to auto-generate the `README.md` file, from the modules registered in the `src/lib.rs`. The script is [here](https://github.com/krshrimali/rust-leetcode/blob/main/update_readme.py).
* Since I wanted to explore how it can be done in Rust, I ported it to Rust as well. The script is [here](https://github.com/krshrimali/rust-leetcode/blob/main/src/main.rs).

Took some break from doing leetcode today, had a lot of work which I unfortunately can't mention here.
