Today was more like a reading/learning day. Here are the things I've been watching:

1. [Which Database Model to choose?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mdadNspP_M):
    - Why this?
        - Going to be useful for the [project](https://github.com/krshrimali/keystroke-store-rs) I've been working on. Thinking on directions of storing in-memory, using key-value model but let's see.
2. [I made every sentry page 300 ms faster (intermediate) anthony explains `#540`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY7EQwT7QKU)
    - Why this?
        - Always enjoy watching Anthony. Came on my YT recommendation, thought I'll watch. Looks like a CDN config fix, also learnt a few things on watching the type of network calls (cached or not) from this video.
3. [How does async rust work](https://bertptrs.nl/2023/04/27/how-does-async-rust-work.html)
    - Still reading, not done yet. Will update my learnings when done.
4. Update NeoVim Config to use ruff-lsp instead of pyright for most except hover
    - Ruff has been there for long, boasts a lot of perf improvements as a linter. Good to see Ruff LSP growing.
    - NeoVim config repository: https://github.com/krshrimali/nvim
    - It's of course going to take a lot of efforts to catch up to pyright in terms of capabilities, but I'm very positive.
    - I love to see code actions finally in my neovim + python code. ðŸŽ‰
    - It's written in Rust, for those who don't know ðŸ˜‰

TODOs:

1. Explore HVM: https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/HVM, looks interesting at least.
2. Read through: [Specifying and Verifying Higher-order Rust Iterators](https://hal.science/hal-03827702v2/document).
3. Record a video for YouTube!

Alright, thank you all for reading. :) See y'all tomorrow!
