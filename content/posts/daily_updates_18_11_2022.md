Hi everyone, Day 5 of this series of daily updates. Started my day, fairly early but was feeling unwell. In any case, I did make some progress with my learning of the Interpreter. One of motivation to learn about Interpreter is to learn the whole process, from the code we write to the object files / executables. Of course, in this goal, my next step would be to read the "Write a compiler in Go" book. But one step at a time, right?

**Projects/Learning**:

1. Completed Chapter 1 (Lexing) of the book "Write an Interpreter in Go". Very detailed, and I love how the author included REPL in the chapter 1. Even though it's not a lot of code, it just makes it so intuitive to run line by line and get the tokens.
2. Started reading Chapter 2 (Parser). Fortunately, I do have some knowledge about grammars, BNF and EBNF forms, and using parser generators. But I agree with the author there, you'll learn a lot if you create the parser from scratch. So I'm looking forward to it.

**Leetcode**:

Revisit most of the problems I've solved so far. Implement them again in C++ and Rust.

Thank you! :)
