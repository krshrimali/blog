Hi everyone! If you've been following my blog, you would have noticed a couple of PyTorch Blogs ([PyTorch C++ API: Installation and MNIST Digit Classification using VGG-16](https://krshrimali.github.io/PyTorch-C++-API/), [PyTorch C++ API: Using Custom Data](https://krshrimali.github.io/Custom-Data-Loading-Using-PyTorch-CPP-API/)). I initially started in a motive to help people getting started with, as there are not a lot of tutorials available on Libtorch (PyTorch C++ API).

**I'm happy to announce a Series of Blog Posts on PyTorch C++ API**. Check out the blogs in the series here:

1. [PyTorch C++ API: Installation and MNIST Digit Classification using VGG-16](https://krshrimali.github.io/PyTorch-C++-API/)
2. [PyTorch C++ API: Using Custom Data](https://krshrimali.github.io/Custom-Data-Loading-Using-PyTorch-CPP-API/)
3. [PyTorch C++ API: Using Custom Data to Train a Network](https://krshrimali.github.io/Training-Network-Using-Custom-Dataset-PyTorch-CPP/)
4. [Classifying Dogs vs Cats using PyTorch C++ API: Part-1](https://krshrimali.github.io/Blog-Dogs-VS-Cats/)
5. [Classifying Dogs vs Cats using PyTorch C++ API: Part-2](https://krshrimali.github.io/Classifying-Dogs-Cats-PyTorch-CPP-Part-2/)
6. [Applying Transfer Learning on Dogs vs Cats Dataset using PyTorch C++ API](https://krshrimali.github.io/Applying-Transfer-Learning-Dogs-Cats/)
7. [Setting up Jupyter Notebook (Xeus Cling) for Libtorch and OpenCV Libraries
](https://krshrimali.github.io/Setting-Up-Xeus-Cling-Libtorch-OpenCV/)

**Note**: This page will be updated as soon as the next blog has arrived.

Happy Reading!
