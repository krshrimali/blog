Hi everyone, Day 4 of this series of daily updates. I don't have a lot to share today, just one of those days where I spent a lot of time going through whatever I've done already. I take some time to look at the things I learned so far, and see if I could be more intuitive back then. I'm going to continue doing the same for the next day, though this time for the problems I've solved on Leetcode.

**Projects/Learning**:

1. Studied a bit about MapReduce algorithm. Surprisingly, there isn't enough about it, except blogs like [this from IBM](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/topics/mapreduce#:~:text=MapReduce%20is%20a%20programming%20paradigm,tasks%20that%20Hadoop%20programs%20perform.) sharing the same old definitions and examples.
2. Spent some time going through possibilities of handwritten recognition using Stable Diffusion, I think it's an interesting area to explore. Autoencoders can do a good job here, and with the amount of data we can generate for this task - it could be huge.

Thank you! :)
