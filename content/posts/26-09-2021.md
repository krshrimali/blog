Hi everyone, before I go ahead and share my progress, I wanted to quickly talk about what this blog is about.

I am highly passionate with the idea of high performance computing, optimizing deep learning applications, and solving real world problems using deep learning, computer vision, and speech processing. While I'm on this path - I would like to document this somewhere. And while I'm doing that, why not share it publicly?

So here it is, the first weekly update blog on what I've been upto:

**PyTorch**: (ft. Quansight and Facebook)

* Followed up on `batch_norm` [PR](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/63218). Merged :tada:
* Structured Kernel porting for `baddbmm, bmm` [PR](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/64805). Lots of interesting discussions, and should be approved after final round of review. Will have to follow up on this coming week.
* Structured Kernel porting (WIP) for `nonzero` [PR](https://github.com/krshrimali/pytorch/pull/13). Putting this on hold, as there is a related PR on this - and it makes more sense to let that one go first, and then start working on this.
* Finished the `max_poolNd` [PR](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/62544), the PR is approved and will be merged after some time.
* While working on [structured kernel for baddbmm, bmm PR](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/64805), we needed to differentiate between in-place and out calls, interestingly - the autogenerated `set_output` function was the answer. A good discussion on this is [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/64805#discussion_r710952117).
* Took a look at implementation of `ArrayRef` class, find the source code [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/c10/util/ArrayRef.h#L41).

**Extras**:

* The concept behind JIT is very interesting, and I wanted to read more about it. Started with [this](http://eecs.ucf.edu/~dcm/Teaching/COT4810-Spring2011/Literature/JustInTimeCompilation.pdf) article on "A Brief History of Just-In-Time". I plan to write a blog on this once I'm done reading.
* Effective Modern C++: I continued reading through Item 12 and Item 13 of Chapter 3:
    * [Declaring Overriding Functions override](https://krshrimali.github.io/posts/2021/09/declaring-overriding-functions-override-notes/)
    * [Prefer const_iterators to iterators](https://krshrimali.github.io/posts/2021/09/prefer-const_iterators-to-iterators-notes/)
* A very interesting blog on `vmap` and `pmap` in Jax is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/aakashnain/tf-jax-tutorials-part-8-vmap-pmap). Read half of it, will continue reading in the next week.
* An interesting watch on [When do I use a union in C or C++, instead of a struct?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9_0bqrm2G8). I like watching such videos when I'm a little tired from work.
* Blog theme:
    * Worked on a new theme inspired by [this theme](https://github.com/haoZeke/hugo-theme-hello-friend-ng-hz/).
    * Re-organized the blog, fixed all the links (wherever it's shared on the internet), in-blog images and cover images as well. Check the milestone [here](https://github.com/krshrimali/krshrimali.github.io/milestone/1).
    * With this blog, the milestone for the blog will be closed. :tada:
* Started reading tutorial on PyTorch's official docs about [Returning a Dispatched Operator in C++](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/dispatcher.html). Half way through, will continue reading in the next week.

Yes, and apart from all of this, I did won a few games of CSGO with my friends, had a few health issues to catch up with (:cry:), updated my [discord channel](https://discord.gg/5tXuYANP7R) with blog announcements, helped a few friends with their doubts, and well, yeah that's it.

I hope to perform better once I feel good (w.r.t health). Thank you for reading.
